> AI for Business is Now, and the Future.

deep-business utilizes ChatGPT to summarize and chat with business papers, helping researchers stay up-to-date with the latest research trends. If you find this project useful, please give it a star!

The project is built on [ChatPaper](https://github.com/kaixindelele/ChatPaper), and adds **parse templates for business papers**, which enables a more precise extraction of paper structure and content, as well as providing more insightful chat answers.
